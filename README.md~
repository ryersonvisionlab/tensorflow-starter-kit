# Tensorflow Starter Kit
It's dangerous to start from scratch! Take this.

This library should serve as a starting point for those who want to quickly build and prototype TensorFlow projects with tools that just work. Pick and choose what you need!

##Planned Features
###Graph Util
..* Visualization tools
..* Data I/O tools
..* Scope management/sharing variables
..* Common layers

###Python Util
..* Visualization/display tools
..* Data I/O tools
..* Hyper Parameter management (hyper param management)
..* Checkpoint management (loading from non checkpoints, numpy files)
..* TF Session management

###Stand Alone tools
..* Checkpoint inspector
..* Checkpoint reMapper (converting between model names)
..* Task Scheduler (maybe even networked!) queue experiements to run
